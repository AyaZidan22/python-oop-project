üß† OOP Project ‚Äì Office Simulation in Python
This project showcases core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts using Python through a simulation of an office environment. It demonstrates how classes interact to model real-life objects such as employees and their vehicles, and how lateness, refueling, and salary management are handled.

# Key Features:
üöó Driving simulation with fuel and velocity tracking
‚õΩ Refueling capability
‚è±Ô∏è Lateness detection based on commute time and speed
üë• Employee management: Hiring and firing functionality
üíµ Salary adjustments: Reward or deduct salary based on punctuality

# Example Usage

from office import Office
from employee import Employee
from car import Car

# Create employees
samy = Employee(
    name="samy",
    money=100,
    mood="Neutral",
    healthRate="75%",
    id=2,
    car=Car("Fiat 128"),
    email="samy@example.com",
    salary=10000,
    distanceToWork=20,
)

aya = Employee(
    name="aya",
    money=100,
    mood="Neutral",
    healthRate="75%",
    id=5,
    car=Car("BMW"),
    email="aya@example.com",
    salary=15000,
    distanceToWork=20,
)

zedan = Employee(
    name="zedan",
    money=100,
    mood="Neutral",
    healthRate="75%",
    id=10,
    car=Car("Tesla"),
    email="zedan@example.com",
    salary=15000,
    distanceToWork=20,
)

# Simulate actions
samy.refuel()
samy.drive(distance=20.0, velocity=60.0)

iti = Office("ITI-Smart-Village", [samy, aya])
print(iti.check_lateness(empId=2, moveHour=6))

iti.hire(zedan)
print(f"Number of employees after hiring: {Office.employeesNum}")
print("Current employee list:")
for emp in iti.employees:
    print(f"{emp.name} with ID: {emp.id}")

print(iti.fire(empId=5))
print(f"Number of employees after firing: {Office.employeesNum}")

print(f"{samy.name} is an employee who works at {iti.name}. He commutes daily (except weekends) using his {samy.car.name} car.")

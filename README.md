# OOP Project – Office Simulation in Python
This project demonstrates core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles using Python by simulating a real-life office environment. It models how different objects—such as employees and their vehicles—interact through classes and methods.

You'll find concepts like inheritance and encapsulation applied to scenarios such as employee management, commuting simulations, and salary adjustments.
